
Temperatures have already dipped between six and eight degrees in a matter of hours in some parts of Spain, said Del Campo. And the northerly wind will increase the feeling of cold.

Temperatures on Friday and Saturday will be “very cold, with lows of five to 10 degrees below average in many parts of northern and eastern Spain, and in the Balearics,” he added.

No snow

However, little to no snow is expected “not for lack of cold, but for lack of precipitation, since the air mass is very dry.”

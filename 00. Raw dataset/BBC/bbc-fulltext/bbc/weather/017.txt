A colder end to January, probably drier than December overall

High pressure is likely to be more prevalent around the UK than it has been in December. 

This drifts north of the UK from mid-month and then tends to lead to cooler weather. 

There is uncertainty about the proximity of low pressure to the south. This could bring some wintry weather.

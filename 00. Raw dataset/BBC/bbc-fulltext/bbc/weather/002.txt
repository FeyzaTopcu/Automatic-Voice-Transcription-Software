Elisabeth, I have no idea how our relationship will weather this. 

With so many people at their house, it was fortunate that the weather was warm and dry so they could utilize the courtyard for the children.

The innkeeper spoke of the weather, of the roads, of the crops, of politics.


The weather grew intermittently warmer and on one of those sunny warm days, Cade invited her to pack a lunch and join him in a ride on the ranch.

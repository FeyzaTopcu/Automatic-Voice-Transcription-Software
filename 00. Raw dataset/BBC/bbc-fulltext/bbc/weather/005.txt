A polar air mass that entered the Iberian peninsula on Wednesday has already caused sharp drops in temperature, but the worst is yet to come, said the national weather service Aemet.

“An episode of intense cold” is forecast for Friday, when the mercury will continue to plummet across much of Spain. Thirty provinces are on yellow alert, the lowest on a three-color scale, except for Guadalajara, where there is an orange advisory in place. Lows of 10 are expected in Parameras de Molina.

Elsewhere, weather stations have recorded 8.2 in La Molina (Girona), at an elevation of 1,700 meters, and 6.8 in Puerto de Navacerrada (Madrid).

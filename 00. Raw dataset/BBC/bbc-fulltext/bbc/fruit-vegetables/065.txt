An ugli fruit is a cross between a grapefruit and a mandarin. 

It is about the size of a grapefruit but it tastes a bit sweeter and has a wrinkly skin that peels easily. 

This fruit comes from Jamaica and is also grown in the USA. 

Despite its name, it's not that ugly although it can look strange because its yellowy green skin is thick, rough and puffy, and sometimes a bit blotchy.

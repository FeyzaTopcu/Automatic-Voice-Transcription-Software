"The pear originated in the general region of the Caucausus, as did its cousin the apple; and both fruits were spread by the Aryan tribes from that area as they migrated into Europe and N. India. 

Both belong to the rose family, Rosaceae. The orginal wild pear has been developed into what are now nearly 1,000 varieties, after a certain amoung of interbreeding with other native wild pears of Europe and Asia...

In ancient times the pear was generally considered a better fruit than the apple. 

Thus in China only one variety of apple was known until the end of the Sung dynasty.

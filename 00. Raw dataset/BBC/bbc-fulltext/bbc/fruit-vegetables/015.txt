Apple, tree fruit important in ancient food and religion. 

Wild apples (crab-apples) of the European wild species gradually spread from northern Anatolia after the last ice age. 

Apples were in due course transplanted, or grown from seed, far to the south of their native habitat, in Mesopotamia in particular, where strings of sliced dried apples are described in literary sources and have been found by archaeologists. In the Near East in the third and second millennia BC the apple was important in cookery, in medicine and also in love charms.

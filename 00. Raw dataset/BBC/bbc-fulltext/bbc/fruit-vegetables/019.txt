"Gooseberry comes under the name of Currant or Curran, but may here obtain a word or two for itself. 

It is known in some of the English shires under the name Carberry, because it is red, or was known chiefly as red; of Feaberry, because it was deemed good for fevers: why it has been called Gooseberry is not so clear. 

The older herbalists always insisted that it was so called because it was used as a sauce for goose; and the analogy of wineberry and feaberry would see to bear them out. 

If this should not be satisfactory, we have to fall back upon the old English gorst, in modern English gorse, in Shakespeare, goss; an etymology which will at the same time account for the Scottish name of the berry, which varies between groset and grosart. 

The Scotch, it must be remembered, are great in gooseberries.

Figs are soft, sweet fruits, full of small seeds, and they're a great source of fibre. 

The skin is very thin  ripe figs do not keep or travel very well, so they are often eaten dried. 

Fresh figs are delicious as a snack, especially with Greek yoghurt and a drizzle of honey. 

Jams and chutneys are often made from figs.

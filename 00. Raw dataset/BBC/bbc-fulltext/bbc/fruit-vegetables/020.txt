"Botanically, the grape is a berry of any species of Vitis, the genus of the vine family that was growing wild over much of the earth long before there were humans about. 

In North America, the vines evolved toward the species V. Labrusca--the fox grape, one variety of which is the Concord grape. 

But practically all of the world's wine comes from varieties of a single Old World species, V. Vinifera--the vine that bears wine. 

It is though to have originated in Asia Minor and, as people early discovered (to their delight) that grapes and their juice ferment, has been cultivated for some 6,000 years.

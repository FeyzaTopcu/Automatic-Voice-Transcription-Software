Most aubergines are teardrop-shaped and have glossy purple skin. On the inside, they are spongy and creamy-white. 

Aubergines grow on bushes and really are fruit although you wouldn't want to eat them raw! 

Perhaps cooked in a Thai chicken curry? 

Australians and Americans call it eggplant because some types look a bit like large eggs.

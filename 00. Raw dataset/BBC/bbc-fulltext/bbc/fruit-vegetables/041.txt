Butternut squash is a large and pear-shaped fruit with a golden-brown to yellow skin. 

Because it contains seeds, it is actually a fruit rather than a vegetable. 

Once peeled and cooked, the flesh is soft and sweet. 

It can be roasted, pureed, mashed or used in soups or casseroles. 

It's a good source of beta-carotene, which is turned into vitamin A in the body. 

Beta-carotene gives the flesh its bright orange colour. 

Bulk up a spaghetti bolognese by adding some butternut squash.

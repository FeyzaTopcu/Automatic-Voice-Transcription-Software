Wild apples grew in prehistoric times. Food historians generally agree they originated in the Caucauses. 

The fruit was introduced to Europe by the Roman legions. They were actively cultivated. 

Apples are considered one of America's symbols because they are prominently featured in recipes throughout our nation's history. 

Apple origins and dispersion is generally revealed through archaolgica, rather than etymological, evidence. 

This is because early words denoting round tree fruit did not necessarily distinguish between specific fruits and varieties. 

Crab apples are said to be the ancestor of cultivated appples.

"The Bergamot Lemon...

There is but one spot in the world where the bergamot tree can be cultivated with profit--a fact of some importance, since the essence is indispensable in the manufacture of numerous perfumes and medical preparations. 

The spot referred to is Reggio, in Calabria...'Enterprising capitalists' would better to a little slow before they jump at the conclusion that the bergamot tree can only be grown in Calabria. 

Bergamot lemons, of fine quality, from Santa Barbara were shown at the citrus fair in Los Angeles a year ago. 

There is no reason why the bergamot lemon should not be grown successfully in Southern California as well as the ordinary Sicily lemon, and other varieties."

"The evolution and spread of the banana has recently been discussed in detail by N.W. Simmonds, but although much is now known of the taxonomy, genetics and more recent origins of this fruit, its early domestication is still rather questionable. 

The wild banana is somewhat unattractive, seedy, and inedible, and has been changed by man from this jungle weed tino a large seedless fruit. 

The wild plants are distributed in tropical Asia and Australiasia ...and certainly this area is the cradle of banana domestication. 

However, the story is not simply one of deliberage selection for larger and larger fruit, and Simmonds has pointed out that in fact the plant may well at first have been cultivated for other reasons. 

In particular, the sheaths yield valuable fibres, the leaves are useful wrapping materials, and from the point of view of food, the soft inner sheaths, the male buds and flowers, and the immature fruits can all be eaten as vegetables...

Thus, fruit improvements probably followed long after the plant was cultivated for these other resasons. 

Literary and archeological evidence for the banana is scattered and as yet very sparse. 

In India, it is not noted before 600 BC, although linguistic studies trace its use back possibley to pre 3000BC. The early African cultivars...

Sometimes called an avocado pear, this fruit is often mistakenly described as a vegetable because we eat it in salads. 

Avocados are at their best when they are ripe. 

They're really easy to prepare simply cut one in half, remove the stone and eat with a little salad dressing or chopped into a salad. 

Avocados are a good source of essential fats (yes, the good ones) and are one of the few fruits that contain fat.

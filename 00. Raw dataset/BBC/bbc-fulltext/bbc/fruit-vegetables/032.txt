"The orange is one of the most important fuits of the world and one of the oldest cultivated. Originating in the Orient, the fruit was cultivated in China as early as 2400 B.C. 

These were "bitter oranges"...later brought to Spain, where they became known as the "Seville orange." 

The "sweet orange"...also originated in China and was also brought to Spain, possibly by the Moors in the eighth century. 

Christopher Columbus brought Canary Islands orange seeds to Hispaniola in 1493, and plantings by the Spanish and Portuguese soon followed throughout the Caribbean, Mexico, and South America.

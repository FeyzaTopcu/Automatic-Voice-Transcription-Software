A great snack in a handy yellow skin! 

Bananas are a good source of energy and contain lots of vitamins and minerals, especially potassium, which is important for the health of cells, nerves and muscles, and helps to lower blood pressure. 

Bananas grow in hanging clusters, sometimes called hands, in tropical regions. 

You can eat them raw, baked, dried or in a smoothie. Or try mashed banana on wholegrain toast it's delicious!

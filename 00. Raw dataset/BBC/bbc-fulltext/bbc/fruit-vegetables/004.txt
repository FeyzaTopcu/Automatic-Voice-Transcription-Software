"Fruit...it its widest sense, any product of the soil that can be enjoyed by man or animals...

Between this wide and frequently figurative use of the word and its application in the strict botanical sense treated below, there is a popular meaning, regarding the objects denoted by the word entirely from the standpoint of edibility, and differentiating them roughly from those other products of the soil, which, regarded similarly, are known as vegetables. 

In this sense, 'fruit' is applied to such seed-envelopes of plants as are edible, either raw or cooked, and are usually sweet, juicy or of a refreshing flavour. 

But applications of the word in this sense are apt to be loose and shifting according to the fashion of the time. 

Fruit, in the botanical sense, is developed from the flower as the result of fertilization of the ovule.

After fertilization various changes take place in the parts of the flower...

In popular language, the fruit includes all those parts which exhibit a striking change as the result of fertilization. 

In general, the fruit is not ripened unless fertilization has been effected; but cases occur as the result of cultivation in which the fruit swells and becomes to all appearances perfect, while no seeds are produced. 

Thus, there are seedless oranges, grapes and pineapples. 

When the ovules are unfertilized, it is common to find that the ovary withers and does not come to maturity; but in the case of bananas, plantains and breadfruit, the...development of seeds seems to lead to a larger growth and a greater succulence of the fruit."

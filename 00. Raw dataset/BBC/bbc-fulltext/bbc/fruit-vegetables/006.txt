"Fruit. 1. The product of a tree or plant in which the sees are contained."

"Vegetable. Anything that has growth without sensation, as plants. 

Vegetables are organized bodies consisting of various parts, containing vessels furnished with different juices; and taking in their nourishment from without, usually by means of a root, by which they are fixed to the earth, or to some body, as in the generality of plants, sometimes by means of pores distributed over the whole surface, as in sub-marine plants."
